## Study experience
- The two CW exams remain largely unchanged each year, one 2D and one 3D. Some of the final exam's problem-solving questions might be unanswerable due to the closed-book format. When preparing for the final exam, don't get bogged down in the details of the PowerPoint slides; just memorize the code, principles, and terminology. I simply don't want to learn freeglut; it's too outdated.
